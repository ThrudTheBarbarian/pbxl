Benefits:

	- Can get in TQFP
	- 5v tolerant
	- Can drive bus directly
	- 16-bits for A, 8 bits for D, 22 bits for others
	- Local 16-bit 1MB SRAM (512kx16, 55ns, IS66WV51216EBLL-55TLI)
	
Procedure:
	- Wait for IRQ on bus-clock
	- stop driving ports
	- Set timer for 170ns - (3+12)*5ns // ports + IRQ response time
	- Read A,D,bits (ports A,B,J) 
		- port A = 16-bit address
		- port B = 8-bit data, 8-bits of signal
		- port J = 16 bits of signal
		- send address-valid
	- On read, check A vs map, if so:
		- set EXTSEL / MPD
		- read byte from SRAM
		- set value
	- On write:
		- wait another ~200ns
		- read byte
		- store byte in SRAM

	- Use 64k jump table to speed up 8-bit "register" write access
	
	- s/w traps to copy data to/from 32MB of SDRAM in GPU territory
	
	- video parsing:
		- use high-bit in jump table to indicate video-mode
		- if bit-set
			use state machine
				read_dlist_addr
				read_lms
				read_data
				...
		- send data over to #2 via dedicated bus
