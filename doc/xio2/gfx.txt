Basic idea is a 2D double-buffered framebuffer, with a windowing system sitting
on top, that writes to the back-buffer.

Need 2 tasks (or possibly combine into 1 for speed)

1) Framebuffer:
	- Has primitives for line, rect, fill etc
	- Uses DMA2D for scaling and blit
	- Based on (a) or (b)

2) WindowServer
	- Higher level of abstraction, provides windows, menus, pointer etc.
	- Calls through to Framebuffer to ger-er-done
	- Always writes to back-buffer
