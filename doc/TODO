Next revision board changes:

 - Screw holes for mounting in a case
 - Test points for anything useful
 - Isolate power-supply areas with 0-ohm resistors or solder bridges
 - Bring out any remaining GPIO inputs to pin headers for debugging
 - Add a cartridge slot header
 - PBI device-selection switch, maybe rotary, maybe just pin-header
 - Default memory-mapping rotary switch or pin-header
 - More 'power-good' LEDs for quick once-over 
 - Move to 1206 size for ease of soldering, maybe use the back as well
 - Elongate the card-edge connector because of 130XE tabs
 - Move to a 10cm^2 board and use SeeedStudio's fusion service rules for layout
 - Will do a board-shrink later


Debugging

 - 1v rail not coming up. EN_1V0 not going high.
 	- Make sure U$11 and U$6 are correct
 	- Also make sure U$5 is correct
 	- Make sure pull-up R27 is correct
