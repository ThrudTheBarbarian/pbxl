Next revision board changes:

 * Screw holes for mounting in a case
 - Test points for anything useful
 * Isolate power-supply areas with 0-ohm resistors or solder bridges
 - Bring out any remaining GPIO inputs to pin headers for debugging
 * Add a cartridge slot header
 * PBI device-selection switch, maybe rotary, maybe just pin-header [dip switch]
 * Default memory-mapping rotary switch or pin-header [dip-switch]
 * More 'power-good' LEDs for quick once-over 
 * Move to 1206 size for ease of soldering, maybe use the back as well
 * Elongate the card-edge connector because of 130XE tabs
 * Move to a 10cm^2 board and use SeeedStudio's fusion service rules for layout
 - Will do a board-shrink later
 * prevent signals going under the oscillator
 * replace the thermal vias in the xmos core
 

Debugging

 - 1v rail not coming up. EN_1V0 not going high.
 	- Make sure U$11 and U$6 are correct
 	- Also make sure U$5 is correct
 	- Make sure pull-up R27 is correct
 	--> design error in supervisor circuit
