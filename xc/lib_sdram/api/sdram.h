/**
 * The actual SDRAM server providing a software interface plus services to access the SDRAM.
 * This provides the software interface to the physical SDRAM. It provides services including:
 *  - Automatic SDRAM refresh,
 *  - Multi-client interface,
 *  - Client prioritisation,
 *  - Client command buffering,
 *  - Automatic multi-line SDRAM access.
 *
 *  \param c_client             This is an ordered array of the streaming channels to the clients. It is in client
 *                              priority order(element 0 being the highest priority).
 *  \param client_count         The number of clients.
 *  \param dq_ah                The data and address bus port.
 *  \param cas                  The CAS signal port.
 *  \param ras                  The RAS signal port.
 *  \param we                   The WE signal port.
 *  \param clk                  The SDRAM clock.
 *  \param cb                   Clock block to control the ports.
 *  \param cas_latency          The CAS latency.
 *  \param row_words            The number of 32b words in a SDRAM row (half the number of columns).
 *  \param col_bits             The count of bits for a memory location, normally 16.
 *  \param col_address_bits     The number of bits in the column address bus.
 *  \param row_address_bits     The number of bits in the row address bus.
 *  \param bank_address_bits    The number of bits in the bank address bus.
 *  \param refresh_ms           The count of milliseconds for a full refresh cycle.
 *  \param refresh_cycles       The count of refresh instructions per full refresh cycle.
 *  \param clock_divider        The divider of the system clock to the SDRAM clock.
